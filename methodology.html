﻿       <h1>Methodology</h1>
       <h2>New Zealand</h2>
       <p>The Party Vote estimates come from a Bayesian State Space Model. This model predicts the support for each party each week going back to the 2014 election. Only on election day do we get an exact and accurate reading of the support for each party. Between elections we must rely on polls whose estimates are uncertain (depending on sample size) and biased (varying by pollster and party). Our model gives us 10,000 samples of party votes for an election held this week. We acknowledge inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/ellisp/nz-election-forecast"> the work of Peter Ellis.</a></p>

       <p>In the background, we predict the party vote and candidate vote in each Māori electorate. These are based on past trends modelled with Dirichlet distributions, and we are indebted to the Split Vote Reports produced by the Electoral Commission. We assume that Labour and TPM will always stand candidates, NZF and ACT will not, and that National and the Greens may or may not. For now, we assume the latter two will run in the same seats as in 2023. We take incumbency into account but not individual candidates or the history of a particular electorate. These predictions are vital for forecasting the performance of TPM, who often win overhang seats (i.e. more electorates than their party vote would entitle them to).</p>

       <p>Predictions for general electorates are being rolled out. Until those are available, we assume that National, Labour, the Greens and ACT will always win an electorate (guaranteeing them seats even if they go below 5%) and will never overhang. We assume NZF will not win an electorate, thus if they fall below 5% we give them 0 seats. Currently we do not consider the possibility that another party or an independent wins a seat.</p>

       <p>Currently, New Zealand politics appears divided into two clear left and right blocs for the first time since the start of MMP. Our coalition outcome probabilities are based on an expectation that if one of these blocs has a majority, that bloc will form the next government. Cross-bloc coalitions such as a National-Greens coalition or a Labour-NZF coalition would only be formed if there was a tie or a coalition could not be formed. All assumptions about electorates and coalitions will revised as necessary.</p>

       <h2>Netherlands</h2>
       <p>Our vote predictions are based on a Bayesian State Model similar to our model for New Zealand elections. An added complication is that many polls release only the number of seats each party is projected to win. We convert these figures into percentages, by reverse engineering the formula used for assigning seats.</p>

       <p>There are 32,767 possible coalitions of 15 parties, in theory. In practice, our list of 42 incompatible pairs of parties means there are only 345 possible coalitions. We also ignore coalitions with 7 or more parties, and those with 6 parties that have no Eerste Kamer majority.</p>

       <p>In a given simulation, if a coalition has a majority in the Tweede Kamer and every party is needed for that majority, the coalition is possible. If taking away the smallest party still results in a majority, every party must contribute in some way to the viability of the coalition for it to be possible. We define three ways this can be done:</p>

       <ul>
       <li><p>Giving the coalition a comfortable 78/150 majority in the TK</p></li>
       <li><p>Giving the coalition a majority (38/75) in the EK</p></li>
       <li><p>Having 10+ EK seats, while the other parties between them have 38 or fewer</p></li>
       </ul>

       <h2>UK</h2>
       <p>The predictions for each constituency uses the same basic approach as our predictions for New Zealand electorates. However the overall predictions come from weighted averages of polls rather than from a SSM. We use both national polls and polls for London, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
