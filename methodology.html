﻿       <h1>Methodology</h1>
       <h2>New Zealand</h2>
       <p>The Party Vote estimates come from a Bayesian State Space Model, where we assume that on election day we get an exact and accurate reading of the support for each party, with polls giving estimates that are uncertain and potentially biased. This gives us 15,000 samples of party votes if an election was held tomorrow. We acknowledge inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/ellisp/nz-election-forecast"> the work of Peter Ellis.</a></p>

       <p>In the background, we predict the party vote and candidate vote in each Māori electorate. These are based on past trends modelled with Dirichlet distributions, and we are indebted to the Split Vote Reports produced by the Electoral Commission since 2005. We may extend our electorate predictions to the General Electorates, though the upcoming redrawing of boundaries following the 2023 census will complicate this.</p>

       <p>We assume that National, Labour, the Greens and ACT will win an electorate no matter what (guaranteeing them seats even if they go below 5%) and will also never overhang (win more electorates than seats they are entitled to from the party vote). NZF is assumed to never win an electorate, thus if they fall below 5% they get 0 seats. We use our predictions of the Māori electorates to determine if TPM will meet the threshold and the size of any overhang. Only the six previously mentioned parties can win seats.</p>

       <p>Presently, New Zealand politics appears divided into two clear left and right blocs for the first time since the start of MMP. Thus our coalition formation predictions don’t consider the possibilities of, for instance, a National-Greens coalition or a Labour-NZF coalition. All assumptions about electorates and coalitions will revised as necessary.</p>

       <h2>Netherlands</h2>
       <p>Our vote predictions are based on a Bayesian State Model similar to our model for New Zealand elections. An added complication is that many polls release only the number of seats each party is projected to win. We convert these figures  into percentages of the vote, by reverse engineering the formula used for assigning seats.</p>

       <p>There are 32,767 possible coalitions of 15 parties, in theory. In practice, our list of 41 incompatible pairs of parties means there are only 479 possible coalitions. We also ignore coalitions with 7 or more parties, and those with 6 parties that have no Eerste Kamer majority.</p>

       <p>In a given simulation, if a coalition has a majority in the Tweede Kamer and every party is needed for that majority, the coalition is possible. If taking away the smallest party still results in a majority, every party must contribute in some way to the viability of the coalition for it to be possible. We define three ways this can be done:</p>

       <ul>
       <li><p>Giving the coalition a comfortable 78/150 majority in the TK</p></li>
       <li><p>Giving the coalition a majority (38/75) in the EK</p></li>
       <li><p>Having 10+ EK seats, while the other parties between them have 38 or fewer</p></li>
       </ul>

       <h2>UK</h2>
       <p>The predictions for each constituency uses the same basic approach as our predictions for New Zealand electorates. However the overall predictions come from weighted averages of polls rather than from a SSM. We use both national polls and polls for London, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
